## Skills learned

During project 2 I learned to organize the files using BEM. I also learned about animations, keyframes and 
how to rotate elements.

```css
@keyframes roll {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.rotation {
	animation: roll 20s linear infinite;
}
```
